#### Final Conclusion
- The training process confirmed that by **correctly recognizing and applying patterns**, a 100% win rate can be achieved under controlled conditions.
- This opens the possibility of **building an AI model that can memorize and utilize these patterns to maximize winning potential**.
- The next step is to **build and test the first AI model** to compare its performance against this manual pattern recognition approach.
